Hi! I'm Ryan Raikman, a soon-to-be graduate of [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/). Next fall, I will start my PhD program in Physics at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://physics.mit.edu/). In my undergrad, studied physics on the astrophysics track, with an additional minor in machine learning. Starting I'm involved with a lot of research, usually applying machine learning models to analyze data or theoretical work. Outside of academics, I'm big into athletics and the outdoors! Lots of [cycling](https://rraikman.github.io/cycling) (check out the page!), but some running, hiking, and skiing as well! (Last updated 4/29/2024)

A hike from my winter at CERN in 2024. This is from my hike up the CrÃªt de la Neige!

A high-altitude lake on my way up the Barrhorn (3610m or 11843ft) in the Pennine Alps, Switzerland!

The Seljalandsfoss - a 60m waterfall in the South of Iceland. I even walked behind it!
