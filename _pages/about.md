Hi! I'm Ryan Raikman, a 4th year (as of Dec 2023) undergraduate at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/). I'm studying physics on the astrophysics track, with an additional minor in machine learning. I'm involved with a lot of research, usually applying machine learning models to analyze data or theoretical work. Outside of academics, I'm big into athletics and the outdoors! Lots of [cycling](https://rraikman.github.io/) (check it out!), but some running, hiking, and skiing as well!

The Seljalandsfoss - a 60m waterfall in the South of Iceland. I even walked behind it!
