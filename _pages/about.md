Hi! I'm Ryan Raikman, a first-year PhD student in Physics at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://physics.mit.edu/). I work in gravtitational wave data analysis, applying machine learning tools to learn for anomalous gravitational wave signals. I also work in Cosmology, looking for ways to measure electrons around galaxies with Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). 
I did my undergrad at Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied physics with an astrophysics concentration, along with a minor in machine learning. Outside of academics, I'm big into athletics and the outdoors! Lots of [cycling](https://rraikman.github.io/cycling) (check out the page!), but some running, hiking, and skiing as well! (Last updated 1/7/2025)

A hike from my winter at CERN in 2024. This is from my hike up the CrÃªt de la Neige!

A high-altitude lake on my way up the Barrhorn (3610m or 11843ft) in the Pennine Alps, Switzerland!

The Seljalandsfoss - a 60m waterfall in the South of Iceland. I even walked behind it!
