Hi! I'm Ryan Raikman, currently a senior (4th year) undergraduate at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/). I'm studying physics on the astrophysics track, with an additional minor in machine learning. I'm involved with a lot of research, usually applying machine learning models to analyze data or theoretical work. Outside of academics, I'm big into athletics and the outdoors! Lots of cycling, but some running, hiking, and skiing as well!
