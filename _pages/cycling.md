For the last ~2 years, I have been pretty involved in road cycling! I ride mostly on the road, but recently have been doing a lot of gravel biking as well. I'm the president of Carnegie Mellon's [Cycling Club](https://www.strava.com/clubs/carnegie-mellon-cycling-club-8373). I've been doing a bit of racing - check out my [road results](https://www.road-results.com/racer/238880). I even dabbled in a bit of [cyclocross](https://www.crossresults.com/racer/213429), but I'm excited to try some more! <br>

In the summer of 2023, I was in Versoix, Switzerland (near Geneve) on a research fellowship. I did some pretty epic rides - check out my [strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/89886847)! Notably, I went to see the tour de france twice. Both were ~200 km rides, and I got some sweet pictures of the pros! <br>

I do a fair bit of training, and love playing the game of tracking all my fitness and performance numbers. I have a profile on [intervals.icu](https://intervals.icu/) - you can follow me for more detailed information. According to Garmin, by VO2 Max is 64-65 mL/kg/min, and a zwift ramp test gives a FTP of 334W.

Here are some datapoints from my power curve: <br>
  5s  - 1525W <br>
  10s - 1356W <br>
  60s - 658W  <br>
  5m  - 399W  <br>
  10m - 349W  <br>
  20m - 315W  <br>
  MAP - 377W  <br>


And here are some pictures!<br>
Here I'm in Capriasca, Switzerland, for a 3-day bike touring trip. I'm right in front - maroon jersey, black shorts. <br>

On this ride, I went to Saint-Gervais-Les-Bains, to watch the 15th stage of the 2023 Tour de France. Here's Tadej Pogacar, with the backdrop of Mont Blanc! <br>

On this ride, I was going up the Col du Sanetsch. It was 25.7km (16mi) long, with an elevation gain of 1818m (5960ft)! Here, I was fuelling up at a grocery store in Sion, Switzerland - look at all that chocolate! <br>
