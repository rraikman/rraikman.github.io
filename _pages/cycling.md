For the last ~2 years, I have been pretty involved in road cycling! I ride mostly on the road, but recently have been doing a lot of gravel biking as well. I'm the president of Carnegie Mellon's [Cycling Club](https://www.strava.com/clubs/carnegie-mellon-cycling-club-8373). I've been doing a bit of racing - check out my [road results](https://www.road-results.com/racer/238880). <br>

In the summer of 2023, I was in Versoix, Switzerland (near Geneve) on a research fellowship. I did some pretty epic rides - check out my [strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/89886847)! Notably, I went to see the tour de france twice. Both were ~200 km rides, and I got some sweet pictures of the pros! <br>

I do a fair bit of training, and love playing the game of tracking all my fitness and performance numbers. I have a profile on [intervals.icu](https://intervals.icu/) - you can follow me for more detailed information. According to Garmin, by VO2 Max is 64-65, and a zwift ramp test gives a FTP of 334W.
